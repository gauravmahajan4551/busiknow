       <p style="color:#006080;font-size:10px;"><h1>What are the Key Roles of the Production Department?</h1>
         <p style="color:#006080;font-size:22px;">
The production department is responsible for converting raw materials and other inputs into finished goods or services. In between the processes of production, the department works to improve the efficiency of the production or assembly line so that it can meet the output targets set by company management and ensure finished products offer consumers the best value and quality.</p>

<p style="color:#006080;font-size:20px;">*Identifying Inputs</p>
<p style="color:#006080;font-size:20px;">*Scheduling Production</p>
<p style="color:#006080;font-size:20px;">*Minimizing Production Costs</p>
<p style="color:#006080;font-size:20px;">*Ensuring Product Quality</p>
<p style="color:#006080;font-size:20px;">*Improve Existing Products</p>
<p style="color:#be2596;font-size:23px;">Production Department Responsibilities in Detail</p>
 <p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Identifying Inputs - </p> <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">A business determines the quantity or volume of goods that should be produced within a certain time frame and passes the information to the production department. To meet production targets, the department establishes the quantity of raw materials and types of machinery and equipment required to achieve the desired output level, and may collaborate with the purchasing department to source the inputs. If there isn't sufficient manpower to support productions process, the production department asks the firm to hire more personnel.</p>
 <p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Scheduling Production - </p> <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">With the inputs ready, the production department schedules production processes. This involves planning the tasks to be completed along the production line and allocating the tasks to various production workers. In a woodworking business, for example, the department determines how long lumber will be allowed to dry before being moved to the machining stage for sawing and bending into shape – and finally through the assembly and finishing stages.</p>
 <p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Minimizing Production Costs - </p> <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">The production department is tasked with finding effective ways to lower production costs. One simple way to do this is to keep the production machinery and equipment well-maintained so the firm does not regularly incur repair costs. Along with advising the business to adopt newer technologies, the department can also assess the production line to identify opportunities for cost reduction. For example, if the type of wood used a long time to air-dry – requiring an investment in wood dryers – it could be less costly for a furniture manufacturer to purchase dried lumber.</p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Ensuring Product Quality –</p> <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">A production department must ensure finished goods meet minimum quality standards. Apart from checking all products for faults as they move through the production process, the department must perform rigorous tests on prototypes for new products to ensure they meet quality benchmarks before undergoing mass production. Techniques such as waste elimination and process standardization also help to ensure and improve product quality.</p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Improve Existing Products – </p><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">From time to time, the production department will furnish the research and development department with information it can use to improve existing products. For example, when the production department of a smartphone manufacturer notices that the material it uses to make phone casings bends when subjected to some pressure, the department must advise the research team so that it can seek stronger materials.</p>

<p style="color:#bea925;font-size:25px;">Key Positions in an Production Department</p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">There are many work in this department.This department is backbone of the any organision. Production is all about making product which is main thing of business so it is important to know all about this department:</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;"> Production Manager –</p><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Production Managers run productions on behalf of the Producer and Line Producer. They help to determine the most efficient and economic way to schedule shoots, negotiate business deals for crews, locations and technical equipment, and make day-to-day production decisions to ensure that productions proceed smoothly. Production Managers are dynamic and highly self-motivated individuals. They should be excellent communicators, prepared to work very long hours, and able to react calmly under intense pressure. The role is challenging but well paid, usually on a freelance basis.</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Production Co-ordinator –</p><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;"> Production Co-ordinators are directly responsible to the Line Producer and Production Manager for scheduling and co-ordinating the communications and day-to-day workings of the whole production team. They co-ordinate the crew, maintain the purchase order log, make sure paperwork is completed and filed, answer the telephone, and ensure that nothing is overlooked. Production Co-ordinators also produce new versions of the script as changes are made. Because they are most responsible for the day-to-day workings of the production office, Production Co-ordinators must work very long hours, particularly in the final week before the start of principal photography. Employment is usually on a freelance basis.</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Production Runner or Production Assistant– </p><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">Production Runners are the foot soldiers of the production team, performing small but important tasks in the office, around the set and on location. Their duties may involve anything from office administration to crowd control, and from public relations to cleaning up locations. Production Runners are usually employed on a freelance basis, are not very well paid, and their hours are long and irregular. However, the work is usually extremely varied and provides a good entry-level role into the film industry.</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Location Manager –</p> <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">The Location Managers’ primary role is to identify and find ideal locations for a film shoot, reporting to the Producer, Director and Production Designer. The role also involves negotiating with each location’s owners about a number of issues, such as the cost and terms of the hire, crew and vehicle access, parking, noise reduction, and what official permissions may be required. Once filming has begun, Location Managers are in charge of managing all aspects of shooting in each location, and also ensuring that every location is handed back to its owners in a satisfactory condition after the shoot..</p>
<p style="color:black;font-size:23px;">Unit Manager –</p> <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">  Unit Managers (UMs) work in the Location Department and support the Location Manager and the Assistant Location Manager. UMs liaise between the film crew and the location, making sure that the property’s residents or landlords are kept informed and happy so that filming can progress quickly. If an angry resident complains because of a noisy generator, the UM must placate them, and try to resolve the problem without impacting on the shooting schedule.</p>
